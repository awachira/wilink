Requirements
============

wiLink requires cmake >= 2.6 and Qt >= 4.6 to build.

On Debian
----------

$ sudo aptitude install cmake libgnome-keyring-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-sql-sqlite libspeex-dev

On Mac OS X
-----------

$ sudo port install cmake qt4-mac speex

Building wiLink
===============

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

See platform specific notes for applicable cmake options.

On Mac OS X
-----------

If you are running MacOS/X and are using Qt from macports, invoke cmake as:

$ cmake .. -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/opt/local/libexec/qt4-mac/bin/qmake

If you want to build specifically for i386 on an x86_64 machine:

$ cmake .. -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/opt/local/libexec/qt4-mac/bin/qmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-arch i386" -DLINK_FLAGS="-arch i386"

Cross compiling for win32
-------------------------

To cross compile for win32 on a Debian machine, install the libqt4-mingw32-dev
and libspeex-mingw32-dev packages from:

  http://dev.jerryweb.org/debian/pool/main/

Then invoke cmake as:

$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/mingw32.toolchain
